I want to try a particular strategy. I want to build the 'Permaculture Systems Flow Diagram' module from the 'Project chat file review' as a separate project with the same tech stack and design principles as the overarching project, and then add it to the project proper. If this is feasible, how would I go about doing this in the most effective, safe, and efficient manner? Feel free to ask me any clarifying questions.
